Few AI companies have asked for permission from content creators before using their data for training, and many of them keep their training data secret. Based on the sources we know about, the core of most AI corpuses appears to be from places where permission is not required, such as Wikipedia and government sites, but it is also copied from the open web and likely even from pirated material. It is not clear whether training an AI on this material is legal.

If a given fact is an actually existing thing to which we have access, then the surest way to establish its factualness is to put ourselves in its presence. We then have direct evidence of it. If we cannot establish factualness by direct evidence, we must rigorously test the authenticity and reliability of whatever indirect evidence we rely upon so that, on the basis of that evidence, we can confidently establish the factualness of the thing.
