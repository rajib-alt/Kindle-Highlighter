Before you go to bed, make a list of anything you did accomplish, and write down a list of what you want to get done tomorrow. Then forget about it. Hit the pillow with a clear mind. Let your subconscious work on stuff while you’re sleeping.

Don’t base your happiness or your self-worth on being the smartest, the most successful, the richest. Being so focused on the end results sets you up for a major fall because there’s ALWAYS going to be someone who’s smarter, more successful, or richer—and every time you see that you’ve fallen short, it will eat away at your motivation.

But seasoned entrepreneurs almost always find and create opportunities within the context of who they are, what they know, and especially who they know.

Few AI companies have asked for permission from content creators before using their data for training, and many of them keep their training data secret. Based on the sources we know about, the core of most AI corpuses appears to be from places where permission is not required, such as Wikipedia and government sites, but it is also copied from the open web and likely even from pirated material. It is not clear whether training an AI on this material is legal.
